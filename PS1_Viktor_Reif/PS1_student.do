Answer questions directly on the do file
Make your code visible in your answer to each question: your results should be replicable using your dofile only. 
Using slash star, copy all tables on the do file. Export your graphs and join them to your email when submitting your PS. 
You may need to search for commands that were not yet introduced in the tutorial - learning to Google questions is an essential skill!

Ã¼berlegen wie das machen
// Q4: Drop individuals for which there is missing information in the variables industry, occupation, grade, union, hours and tenure !!!using a loop!!!. 

// Q5: According to this sample, is there a !!significant!! difference in hourly wage between married and single people? 
// Is there also a significant difference in terms of usual hours worked? 
// Can you think of an explanation for these results? 

// Q6: Is there a significant difference between people that were never married and those that were? 
// Are these results in line with what you found for Q5? How many individuals are divorced? 

// Q7: Check the distribution of hourly wages in this country using a graph. What can you say? 
// Check how many individuals in the sample earn more than 40$ per hour. Which occupation 
// is the most frequent among these individuals? 

// Q8: Regress hourly wages on marriage status, and interpret the coefficient. 

// Q9: In a second regression, regress hourly wages on marriage status, controlling 
// for usual hours worked. What can you say about the results? 

// Q10: Create a graph that represents the relationship between the average hourly wage and the 
// average usual hours worked for each occupation. (Hint: collapse function might be useful here)

// Q1 (1pt): What is the research question the authors address in their paper?
// Why is it relevant? 

// Q2 (2pt): Explain the difference between conditional cash transfers and unconditional cash transfers.
// What are the advantages and disadvantages of both transfers? (2pts)

// Q3 (2pt): According to the authors, why is there a significant reduction in teen pregnancies and marriage in 
// the UCT arm but no significant effect in the CCT arm?
